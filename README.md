# Java-Learning

## Recurring:

* scannerName.nextLine() after every numeral input to prevent line skipping
* Encase user input in a while loop with a boolean condition, ie - boolean hasNextInt = scannerTest.hasNextInt(); while (hasNextInt ==  true)...
* Prevents Java exception error; gives a chance to re-route to re-ask for another input or just exit program gracefully
